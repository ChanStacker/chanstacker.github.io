* Repo trades are usually trades that have a next day maturity
* The underlying of a repo trades can be bonds ie a bond is exchanged overnight in exchange for an amount of cash and upon maturity (the following day), the reverse happens with an interest paid with the cash.
* Repos can be used for leverage ie if a trader has an amount of cash x, he can use it to buy 10 bonds and then repo the 10 bonds to get cash to buy another 10 bonds.  In doing so multiple times, he can then increase his exposure on the initial cash x.
