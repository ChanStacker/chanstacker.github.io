On this page we wil talk about kafka consumer.

## This is here!

1) The Java api allows to consume messages in batches unlike the .NET (Confluent api) which provides a Consume method on the Consumer and return 1 message per consume if available.  This is to mimic the librdkafka API (C/C++) upon which the .NET api is built.
> A Batchconsumer implementation can easily be implemented with a specified batch size.
