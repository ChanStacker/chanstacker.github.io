1) The DBContext is a short lived instance, desgined for a single unit of work, after which the entity framework provider takes care of disposing.
2) When creating a dbcontext at application level, simply derive from DbContext and have public constructor that takes a DbContextOptions.  (DbContextOptions options)
3) EF provides 2 ways to sync the db context to the database
    1) From code to databse => use Migration
    2) From database to code => use Reverse Engineering - eg Scaffold from DBContext
4) Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer from Nuget into the target project ie the project that will host your db context and other db elements.
5) Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools as an alternative to installing dotnet ef globally.
