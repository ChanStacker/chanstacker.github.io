* Ever since I started with building .Net applications, Log4Net has my logging framework of choice.
* The different ways to config it whether it is a config section in the application config or a dedicated log4net.config file, it does offer a decent level of settings and flexibility.
* I cannot say as much about the conversion pattern options.  Caller information parameters do not seeem to work consistently.
* %class - which adds the fully qualified class name to the log message - works correctly in a .Net 5 application but not in a .Net framework 4.7.2 application.
