* Blazor comes in 2 flavours - Blazor Server and Blazor Web Assembly
* Blazor Server executes .Net code on the server side and generates html and events that is sent to the browser through Signal-R.
* Blazor Web Assembly functions like a SPA whereby the browser hosts a .Net runtime that executes .Net dll and renders the UI.
