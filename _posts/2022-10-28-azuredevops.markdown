* There are 4 core processes to organise a project in Azure Devops: Basic, Agile, Scrum, CMMI
* Agile and Scrum are the more common processes used by software development team and provides adequate framework to express various situations that may be encountered during the project.
* Agile components are Epic, Feature, User Story, Task with Issue for bugs.
* Scrum components are Epic, Feature, Product Backlog Item, Task and Impediment for bugs.
* Even though the elements are somewhat similar, the difference lies in the structure of these 2 processes.  Scrum being tied to sprints where as Agile being run as a workflow with iterations.
