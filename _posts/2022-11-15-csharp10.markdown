* To reduce on boilerplate code, Microsoft has introduced Global using directives
* When specified as Global, a directive becomes available to the whole project.
* Best practice would be to create a dedicated class `GlobalUsings.cs` and specify the directives as below.  It also works with static and aliases:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
global using Mycustom.namespace;
global using static Mystatic.namespace;
global using Mine = MyOther.namespace;
{% endhighlight %}

* There are also project level properties called `ImplicitUsings`
