* A Linux Process is an individual entity that is allocated system resources by the operating system.
* It has it's own memory space and CPU cyles and can exist independently from other processes unless the program running the process has interelated processes.
* A process has an id, the PID which can be displayed with `top`
* Linux representation of thread is different from Windows in the sense that a thread is viewed as a lightweight process in Linux.

* These are the types of processes running in Linux:
    - Kernel Thread - tasks started and controlled by the OS
    - Threads -
