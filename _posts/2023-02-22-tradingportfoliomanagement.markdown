* `Portfolio Management` for trading desks are usually handled by the Middle to Back office of financial organisation.
* A big part of it is feeding the trading activities and lifecycle events into a `General Ledger`, through an automated system hopefully.
* The `Portfolio Management` system is also relied on to apply the accounting methodologies and trade lifecycle schedules.
